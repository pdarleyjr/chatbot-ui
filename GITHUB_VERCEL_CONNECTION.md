## If You Don't Have Access to @superman32432432

If you don't have access to the @superman32432432 GitHub account:

1. **Contact the account owner**
   - Reach out to whoever owns this GitHub account
   - Ask them to add your repository to their Vercel project
   - Or ask them to transfer ownership of the Vercel project to your account

2. **Create a new Vercel project**
   - If you can't access the @superman32432432 account, you may need to:
     - Create a new Vercel project
     - Connect it to your own GitHub account
     - Deploy from scratch

## Alternative: Use Vercel CLI

If you continue having issues with the GitHub connection, you can deploy using the Vercel CLI:

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```
   vercel login
   ```

3. **Deploy from your local directory**
   ```
   cd c:/Users/Peter Darley/Desktop/chatbot-ui
   vercel
   ```

4. **Follow the CLI prompts to configure your project**

This approach bypasses the need for GitHub integration initially, though you'll want to set up proper integration later for continuous deployment.
