This is a placeholder for the model_quantized.onnx file.

In a production environment, you would need to download the actual model file from Hugging Face or another source.

The actual model file is a binary file that contains the weights for the gte-small model.

You can download the model from:
https://huggingface.co/Supabase/gte-small

After downloading, rename this file to model_quantized.onnx (remove the .txt extension).
